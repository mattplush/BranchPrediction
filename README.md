# BranchPrediction

This is an object oriented program that simulates a one and two bit branch prediction. The class OneBitPredictor simulates the 1 bit predcitor, and TwoBitPredictor simulates the two bit predictor. There are two seperate functions for randomly determining the next branch outcome: next_branch_outcome_loop and next_branch_outcome_random. At the bottom, you can pass diferent values to the test functions to see the percent of the time the predictor's are correct.
